# STM32CubeWL MCU Firmware Package

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWL.svg?color=brightgreen)

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease developers' life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform (this repo), delivered for each series (such as the STM32CubeWL for the STM32WL series).
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM tm core implemented in this STM32 product
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers : an abstraction drivers layer, the API ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio 
   * The BSP Drivers of each evaluation or demonstration board provided by this STM32 series 
   * A consistent set of middlewares libraries such as RTOS, FatFS, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, Key Management Services ...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications or demonstrations) for each board provided by this STM32 series
   
The **STM32CubeWL MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32WL series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications/Demonstration/Examples). 

## Boards available
  * STM32WL 
    * [NUCLEO-WL55JC](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-wl55jc.html)

## Troubleshooting

**Caution** : The **Issues** requests are strictly limited to submit problems or suggestions related to the software delivered in this repo
