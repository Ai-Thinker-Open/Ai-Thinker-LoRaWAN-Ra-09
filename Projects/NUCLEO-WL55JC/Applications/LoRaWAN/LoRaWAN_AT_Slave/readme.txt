@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a LoRa application
modem that is controlled though AT command interface over UART by an external host,
like a computer executing a terminal.

This application is targeting the STM32WLxx Nucleo board embedding the STM32WLxx.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on the STM32WLxx Nucleo boards. Both NUCLEO-WL55JC1 (HIGH-BAND) and NUCLEO-WL55JC2 (LOW-BAND) are suitable.

  - STM32WLxx Nucleo board Set-up
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to micro-B
      to ST-LINK connector.
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector jumpers are fitted.

  - Configure the software via the configuration files:
    - sys_conf.h, radio_conf.h, lorawan_conf.h, lora_app.h, Commissioning.h, se-identity.h, mw_log_conf.h, main.h, etc
    - Careful:
        - the region and class chosen on LoRaWAN/App/lora_app.h shall be compatible with LoRaWAN/Target/lorawan_conf.h list

  -Set Up:

             --------------------------  V    V  --------------------------
             |      LoRa Object       |  |    |  |      LoRa Network      |

             --------------------------          --------------------------

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Open a Terminal, connected the LoRa Object
  - UART Config = 9600, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control
  - Terminal Config: Select 'CR+LF' for Transmit New-Line and switch 'Local echo' on
  - Reset the board
  - type AT? to get all available commands
  - Send your AT commands by typing them in the terminal

@par How to debug ?
  - make sure the flag DEBUGGER_ENABLED to 1 in sys_conf.h
  - simpler to define the flag LOW_POWER_DISABLE to 1 as well
  - compile, download and attach

@par How to use MX to modify some RF middleware and application settings
  This example is compatible (with some problems/limitations) with STM32CubeMX 
  and the RF application and middleware configuration can be modified via GUI. Few warnings and guidelines:
  - ioc file is provided in the project directory and can be opened with STM32CubeMX v6.7.0 or higher.
  - warning: when regenerating with the provided ioc file, 
    the IDE projects are regenerated and paths to HAL and MWs files from STM32Cube/Repository location are erroneously added; to avoid that, 
    user shall uncheck the "Use Default Firmware Location" in the GUI "Project-Manager" panel
    and shall replace "Firmware Relative Path" with the root directory of the STM32CubeWL firmware package  (e.g. C:\myDir\STM32Cube_FW_WL_V1.3.0\);
    problem will be fixed in next STM32CubeMX version.
  - .extSettings file allows to add to the generated IDE projects additional files not generated natively by MX (e.g. BSP files).
  - when regenerating on existing code and existing linker files:
    - STM32CubeMX updates the existing project content and preserves linker files.
    - STM32CubeMX does not update the USER CODE sections (lines between /* USER CODE BEGIN Xxx */ and /* USER CODE END Xxx */).
  - when regenerating after copying only the ioc file in an empty directory:
    - STM32CubeMX generates default project files and default linker files. (Please check original linker file from project directory)
    - it is up to the user to to fill the USER CODE sections with his application code.

@par How to use it with Azure ThreadX RTOS?
  This example can be combined with Azure ThreadX RTOS via STM32CubeMX. The video tutorial:
  "STM32WL - How to port an existing RF application on Azure ThreadX RTOS"
  is available on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnMKNibPkDnE2eaR-ZGM3ZJXadyQLtTpX
