@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a Dual Core (CM4 / CM0) Ping-Pong application
between two PingPong Devices.

The PingPong Device can be
   - a STM32WL Nucleo board
   - a LoRa Radio expansion board or a B-L072Z-LRWAN1
The applications aims to show a simple RX/TX RF link between the two PingPong devices,
one will be called Ping the other will be called Pong.
By default, each PingPong Device starts as a master and will transmit a "Ping" message, and then wait for an answer.
At start-up, each PingPong Device has its two LEDs blinking.
When boards will synchronize (Tx window of one board aligned with Rx window of the other board)
the Ping Device (board receiving "Ping" msg) will blink green LED and the Pong Device (board receiving "Pong" msg) will blink red LED.
The first PingPong Device receiving a "Ping" message will become a slave and answers the master with a "Pong" message.

Logs via hyperterminal complement LEDs indicators.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on the STM32WLxx Nucleo boards. Both NUCLEO-WL55JC1 (HIGH-BAND) and NUCLEO-WL55JC2 (LOW-BAND) are suitable.

  - STM32WLxx Nucleo board Set-up
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to micro-B
      to ST-LINK connector.
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector jumpers are fitted.

  - Configure the software via the configuration files:
    - CM0PLUS (Mw and radio drivers config)
        - sys_conf.h, radio_conf.h, mw_log_conf.h, main.h, etc
    - CM4 (Subghz application)
        - sys_conf.h, nucleo_conf.h, main.h, etc

  -Set Up:

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all CM4 files and load your image into CM4 target memory
  - Rebuild all CM0PLUS files, set PWR_CR4_C2BOOT flag via CM4 and load your image into CM0PLUS target memory
  - Do the same for second board
  - Reset the two boards
  - Run the example on two boards
  - Open two Terminals, each connected to their respective PingPong Device
  - UART Config = 115200, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control

@par How to debug ?
  - Open your preferred toolchain and select CM4 project
  - define the flag DEBUGGER_ENABLED to 1 in CM4\Core\Inc\sys_conf.h
  - define the flag LOW_POWER_DISABLE to 1 at least on one MCU (CM4 or CM0PUS)
  - compile and download
  - put a breakpoint in sys_app.c one line after HAL_PWREx_ReleaseCore(PWR_CORE_CPU2);
  - run CM4 (the above functions sets PWR_CR4_C2BOOT flag)
  - open a second instance of your preferred toolchain and select CM0PLUS project
  - to debug CM0PLUS as well, define the flag DEBUGGER_ENABLED to 1 in CM0PLUS\Core\Inc\sys_conf.h
  - define the flag LOW_POWER_DISABLE to 1 at least on one MCU (CM4 or CM0PUS)
  - compile and download using "Download active application"
  - once CM0PLUS code is downloaded reset (system reset) the CM4
  - run CM4 to the breakpoint again
  - attach to running target CM0PLUS
         (CM0PLUS is in a while loop waiting CM4 to give green light to go further)
         (this is done to prevent CM0PLUS to execute too much code before attaching)
  - on CM4 execute MBMUXIF_SetCpusSynchroFlag(1); this will allow CM0PLUS to exit the while loop

@par How to use MX to modify some RF middleware and application settings
  This example is compatible (with some problems/limitations) with STM32CubeMX 
  and the RF application and middleware configuration can be modified via GUI. Few warnings and guidelines:
  - ioc file is provided in the project directory and can be opened with STM32CubeMX v6.7.0 or higher.
  - warning: when regenerating with the provided ioc file, 
    the IDE projects are regenerated and paths to HAL and MWs files from STM32Cube/Repository location are erroneously added; to avoid that, 
    user shall uncheck the "Use Default Firmware Location" in the GUI "Project-Manager" panel
    and shall replace "Firmware Relative Path" with the root directory of the STM32CubeWL firmware package  (e.g. C:\myDir\STM32Cube_FW_WL_V1.3.0\);
    problem will be fixed in next STM32CubeMX version.
  - .extSettings file allows to add to the generated IDE projects additional files not generated natively by MX (e.g. BSP files).
  - when regenerating on existing code and existing linker files:
    - STM32CubeMX updates the existing project content and preserves linker files.
    - STM32CubeMX does not update the USER CODE sections (lines between /* USER CODE BEGIN Xxx */ and /* USER CODE END Xxx */).
  - when regenerating after copying only the ioc file in an empty directory:
    - STM32CubeMX generates default project files and default linker files. (Please check original linker file from project directory)
    - it is up to the user to to fill the USER CODE sections with his application code.
  This SubGHz_Phy project is based on "Advanced template" (MX GUI Application). 
  USER CODE SECTION are filled to end up with "Switch_Fhss_Fsk_Lora" project.

@par How to use it with Azure ThreadX RTOS?
  This example can be combined with Azure ThreadX RTOS via STM32CubeMX (CM4 core only).
  The video tutorial: "STM32WL - How to port an existing RF application on Azure ThreadX RTOS"
  is available on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnMKNibPkDnE2eaR-ZGM3ZJXadyQLtTpX
  but not sufficient for the complete porting of this example.
  After following the video instructions the user shall open "CM4\subghz_phy_app.c" and manually:
  - delete "stm32_seq.h" inclusion
  - delete the line "UTIL_SEQ_RegTask((1 << CFG_SEQ_Task_SubGHz_Phy_App_Process), UTIL_SEQ_RFU, PingPong_Process);
  - call PingPong_Process(); function within /* USER CODE App_Main_Thread_Entry_Loop */
  - replace "UTIL_SEQ_SetTask(..) calls" with tx_thread_resume(&App_MainThread);
